Service_Scanner.bat is a script that takes the input from file 'machines.txt', finds the version of the OS that is running, given that the RPS service is running, and outputs it to 'system_info.txt'

The input file, 'machines.txt', needs each hostname to be on its own individual line.

The output file, 'system_info.txt', will detail each hostname to its OS Version.
